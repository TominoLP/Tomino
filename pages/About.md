### Hobbies
When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me exploring virtual worlds through gaming. I'm a fan of titles like Minecraft, Apex Legends, League of Legends, Titanfall, and Kingdom Classic. Gaming isn't just a pastime for me; it's a source of inspiration and creativity.

### Coding Enthusiast
I'm passionate about coding, and I spend my free time honing my skills and exploring new technologies. Whether it's crafting a new project or contributing to open-source communities, I'm always eager to learn and share my knowledge.
