# Git Commit Message Convention
published on 01.02.2024 by Tom Werth

## Introduction
When working on a project, it's essential to maintain a clean and consistent Git commit history. This practice helps you and your team understand the changes made to the codebase and makes it easier to track down bugs and issues. To achieve this, you should follow a commit message convention that provides a clear and concise description of the changes made in each commit.

**i have used this as a guide and added my own changes to it: \
[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-%23FE5196?logo=conventionalcommits&style=for-the-badge)](https://conventionalcommits.org)**


### Conventional Commit Plugin for IntelliJ
This plugin helps you to create conventional commit messages in IntelliJ IDEA.\
[![Conventional Commit Plugin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commit%20Plugin-1.0.0-%23FE5196?logo=intellij%20idea&style=for-the-badge)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13389-conventional-commit) \
big shutout to [Edoardo Luppi](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/vendor/d393beff-80ce-4714-b600-bc02eff0571c) for creating this plugin.

**I will eventually create my own Plugin for this.**

## Summary
This Convention is based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, which defines a set of rules for creating commit messages. The goal of this convention is to provide a consistent and easy-to-understand format for commit messages, making it easier to track changes and understand the history of a codebase.

### The commit message should be structured as follows:

```xml
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

    <body>:
        [optional body]
        
    <footer>:
```
### Type
**The type of the commit message, which can be one of the following:**\
`fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test`

**fix:** _A bug fix_\
**feat:** _A new feature_\
**build:** _Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies_\
**chore:** _Other changes that don't modify the source code_\
**ci:** _Changes to the CI configuration files and scripts_\
**docs:** _Documentation changes_\
**style:** _Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)_\
**refactor:** _Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature_\
**perf:** _Changes that improve performance_\
**test:** _Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests_

---

## Optional Scope
**An optional scope that provides additional context for the commit.**\
**Examples:**\
`feat(parser): <description>`\
`fix(core): <description>`\
`style(css): <description>`

---

## Description

**A short description of the changes made in the commit.**\
**Examples:**\
`feat(parser): add new feature`\
`fix(core): resolve issue with parsing URL`\
`style(css): update styles for header`

---

## Body

**A more detailed description of the changes made in the commit.**\

**Body Types:**\
`BREAKING_CHANGE: [optional body]`\
`Closes: <issue number> [optional body]` \
`Changes: [optional body]`

---

## Optional Body

**An optional body that provides additional context for the commit.**\
**Examples:**\
`BREAKING_CHANGE: update parser to use new syntax`\
`Closes: #123, #456`\
`Changes: update parser to use new syntax, change the way URLs are parsed to regex`

---

## Footer

**An optional footer that provides additional information about the commit.**\

**Footer Types:**\
`Author: <author>` \
`Co-Authored-By: <author>` \
`Reviewed-By: <author>` \
`Tested-By: <author>` \
`Depends-On: <commit hash>` 

**author:**
`FirstName LastName <mail@example.com>`

### Examples
```txt
feat(parser): add new feature

    Closes: #123, #456
    Changes: 
     - update parser to use new syntax,
     - change the way URLs are parsed to regex

```
## Conclusion

By following this commit message convention, you can ensure that your commit history is clean and easy to understand. This will make it easier for you and your team to track changes and understand the history of your codebase. Additionally, it will help you maintain a consistent and professional approach to version control, which is essential for any software development project.
